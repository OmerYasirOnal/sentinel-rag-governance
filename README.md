# Sentinel — Agentic RAG Governance for Software Delivery

Docs-first baseline for a stand-alone project that provides governance, guardrails, and evidence for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows in software delivery contexts. This repository stays minimal and private until competition submission.

## Repository structure

- `docs/one-pager.md`: concise problem, solution, and value summary.
- `docs/architecture.md`: conceptual architecture and integration boundaries.
- `docs/demo-script.md`: proposed demo flow and success criteria.
- `docs/screenshots/README.md`: guidance for storing and describing demo visuals.
- `docs/competition/turkcell-yttl/`: competition-specific content (scope decision, application text blocks, repository skeleton plan, Word template guidance).

## Working guidelines

- No reuse of external confidential IP or branding.
- Keep all additions documentation-led; defer implementation details until scope is approved.
- Avoid public disclosure before submission; prefer private sharing channels only.
