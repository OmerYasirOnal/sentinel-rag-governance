# Screenshots guidance

- Keep images private until submission; store only approved redacted visuals.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `evidence-pack-step-1.png`).
- Pair each image with a short caption explaining the scenario and what is shown.
- Prefer lightweight mock data over production content.
- If sharing externally, verify that no confidential details appear in UI chrome or logs.
